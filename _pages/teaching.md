In Fall 2023/2024, I was the lectuer of INTR6000J: Spatio-Temporal Data Mining and Analytics.

During my PhD candidacy at National University of Singapore (NUS), I spent **250+** hours on teaching (as a Teaching Assistant) for several CS courses. Specifically, I worked with several senior teaching staffs in the following courses:

- **Deep learning** (CS5242), graduate level, working with Dr. [Wei Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=46Dd4v4AAAAJ&hl=en)

- **Machine learning** (CS3244), undergraduate level, working with Prof. [Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/)

- **Introduction in Computer Networks** (CS2105), undergraduate level, working with Prof. [Roger Zimmermann](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/rogerz/)

- Programming Methodology (CS1010S), undergraduate level, working with Prof. [Ben Leong](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/bleong/)
